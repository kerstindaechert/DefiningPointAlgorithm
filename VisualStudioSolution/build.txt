# Build DefiningPoint with Visual Studio

## Use/adjust the example Visual studio solution
This Visual Studio solution can be used for compiling the algorithm on a Windows machine.
The solution assumes that CPLEX is installed in the default path: "C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio_Community129".
If CPLEX uses another path or version, adjust the path in the file DefiningPoint.vcx.proj 
or by using the GUI of Visual Studio.

## Set up  your own Visual Studio solution

1. Create a new empty Visual Studio project.

2. From the main project window, navigate to Build | Configuration Manager. Set the Active solution configuration to Release, 
and that Active solution platform is set to whatever matches your CPLEX installation (e.g. x64).

3. Linking: Open Project | [project name] Properties.
Open Configuration Properties | C/C++ | General. 
Edit Additional Include Directories to include the file paths both the CPLEX and the CONCERT
directories: C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio127\cplex\include;C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio127\concert\include

4. In "Preprocessor": add the following to the Preprocessor Definitions:
WIN32;
_CONSOLE;
IL_STD

5. Go to "Linker | General": Edit Additional Library Directories to include the stat_mda folders in both the CPLEX and the CONCERT directories, separated
C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio129\cplex\lib\x64_windows_vs2015\stat_mda;C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio127\concert\lib\x64_windows_vs2015\stat_mda

6. In "Linker" go to Input. Edit the Additional Dependencies to contain the .lib files for
CPLEX (including your version number, e.g. 12.9.0), CONCERT, and ILOCPLEX:
cplex1290.lib;
concert.lib;
ilocplex.lib
