Instructions for linux users:

1) Download the Makefile and create a new folder called classes. Therein, create two folders src and include.

2) Download all files from folder Sources and add them as follows to your folder structure:
   * main.cpp is on the same level as folder classes
   * include contains all header files, i.e. main.h, Efficient.h, DefiningPoint.h and Box.h
   * src contains DefiningPoint.cpp
  
3) Further instructions can be found in file build.txt
